abstract: "In this work, we demonstrate a Chinese classical poetry generation system called Deep Poetry. Existing systems for Chinese classical poetry generation are mostly template-based and very few of them can accept multi-modal input. Unlike previous systems, Deep Poetry uses neural networks that are trained on over 200 thousand poems and 3 million ancient Chinese prose. Our system can accept plain text, images or artistic conceptions as inputs to generate Chinese classical poetry. More importantly, users are allowed to participate in the process of writing poetry by our system. For the user's convenience, we deploy the system at the WeChat applet platform, users can use the system on the mobile device whenever and wherever possible. "
