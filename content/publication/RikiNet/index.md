abstract: "Reading   long   documents   to   answer   open-domain questions remains challenging in nat-ural language understanding. In this paper, weintroduce a new model, called RikiNet, whichreads Wikipedia pages for natural question an-swering.    RikiNet  contains  a  dynamic  para-graph  dual-attention  reader  and  a  multi-levelcascaded answer predictor. The reader dynam-ically  represents  the  document  and  questionby utilizing a set of complementary attentionmechanisms.  The representations are then fedinto the predictor to obtain the span of the shortanswer, the paragraph of the long answer, andthe  answer  type  in  a  cascaded  manner.   Onthe  Natural  Questions  (NQ)  dataset,  a  singleRikiNet achieves 74.3 F1 and 57.9 F1 on long-answer  and  short-answer  tasks.   To  our  bestknowledge, it is the first single model that out-performs the single human performance.  Fur-thermore,  an  ensemble  RikiNet  obtains  76.1F1  and  61.3  F1  on  long-answer  and  short-answer tasks, achieving the best performanceon the official NQ leaderboard"
