abstract: "Recently, Chinese poetry generation gains many significant achievement with the development of deep learning. However, existing methods can not generate Chinese palindrome poetry. Besides, there is no public dataset of Chinese palindrome poetry. In this paper, we propose a novel Chinese palindrome poetry generation model, named Chinese Palindrome Poetry Generation Model (CPPGM), based on the universal seq2seq model and language model with specific beam search algorithms. In addition, the proposed model is the first to generate Chinese palindrome poetry automatically, and is applicable to other palindromes, such as palindrome couplets. Compared with several methods we propose, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CPPGM with machine evaluation as well as human judgment."
