For example, the natural language processing model GPT, after years of development, now has 175 billion network parameters and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP benchmarks. However, according to the existing deep neural network organization, the current large-scale network is difficult to reach the scale of human brain biological neural network connection. At the same time, the existing large-scale DNNs do not perform well in multi-channel collaborative processing, knowledge storage, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired large-scale DNN model, which is inspired by the division and the functional mechanism of brain regions and built modularly by the functional of the brain, integrates a large amount of existing data and pre-trained models, and proposes the corresponding learning algorithm by the functional mechanism of the brain. The DNN model implements a pathway to automatically build a DNN as an output using the scene as an input. Simultaneously, it should not only learn the correlation between input and output but also needs to have the multi-channel collaborative processing capability to improve the correlation quality, thereby realizing knowledge storage and reasoning ability, which could be treated as a way toward general artificial intelligence. The whole model and all data sets and brain-inspired functional areas are managed by a database system which is equipped with the distributed training algorithms to support the efficient training of the large-scale DNN on computing clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to implement general artificial intelligence. Eventually, the large-scale model is validated on several different modal tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Brain-Inspired Large-Scale Deep Neural Network System.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiulin Lang","Chenwei Tang","Yi Gao","Jiancheng Lv"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638662400,"objectID":"134da7afef1ec36e35354d43a29564d3","permalink":"https://www.dicalab.cn/publication/knowledge-distillation-method-for-surface-defect-detection/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knowledge-distillation-method-for-surface-defect-detection/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a multi-scale attention mechanism-guided knowledge distillation method for surface defect detection.

Thus, in the proposed CMDL method, we introduce an object detection network based on YOLO-v3 to detect the focus areas we need, so as to reduce the interference of noise and improve the cataract detection accuracy of our method. Considering that the B-ultrasound image dataset we collected is small-scale, we also design three feature extraction modules to avoid over-fitting of the deep neural networks. Among them, there are a depth features extraction module based on DenseNet-161, a shape features extractor based on Fourier descriptor, and a texture features extraction module based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix. Moreover, we also introduce the collaborative learning module to improve the generalization of the proposed model. Specifically, we first fuse the depth, shape, and texture features of the eyeball and lens, respectively. Then, the fused features of the eyeball and lens are concatenated as the input of collaborative network.

Conventional 3D methods are usually based on statistical models with poor capacity, which limit the description of such complex relationship. Moreover, the required high-quality data are difficult to collect. In this study, we present a novel craniofacial reconstruction paradigm that synthesize craniofacial images from 2D computed tomography scan of skull data. The key idea is to recast craniofacial reconstruction as an image translation task, with the goal of generating corresponding craniofacial images from 2D skull images. To this end, we design an automatic skull-to-face transformation system based on deep generative adversarial nets. The system was trained on 4551 paired skull-face images obtained from 1780 CT head scans of the Han Chinese population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only database of this magnitude in the literature. Finally, to accurately evaluate the performance of the model, a face recognition task employing five existing deep learning algorithms, —FaceNet, —SphereFace, —CosFace, —ArcFace, and —MagFace, was tested on 102 reconstruction cases in a face pool composed of 1744 CT-scan face images.

A common solution often resorts to sequence-level knowledge distillation by rebuilding the training dataset through autoregressive generation (hereinafter known as “teacher AG”). The success of such methods may largely depend on a latent assumption, i.e., the teacher AG is superior to the NAG model. However, in this work, we experimentally reveal that this assumption does not always hold for the text generation tasks like text summarization and story ending generation. To provide a feasible solution to the multimodality problem of NAG, we propose incorporating linguistic structure (Part-of-Speech sequence in particular) into NAG inference instead of relying on teacher AG. More specifically, the proposed POS-constrained Parallel Decoding (POSPD) method aims at providing a specific POS sequence to constrain the NAG model during decoding. Our experiments demonstrate that POSPD consistently improves NAG models on four text generation tasks to a greater extent compared to knowledge distillation.

As the population ages, the incidence of cataracts is on the rise. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for cataracts. The routine early diagnosis relies on B-scan eye ultrasound images, developing deep learning-based automatic cataract detection makes great sense. However, ultrasound images are complex and contain irrelevant backgrounds, the lens takes up only a small part. Besides, detection networks commonly use only one label as supervision, which leads to low classification accuracy and poor generalization. This paper focuses on making the most of the information in the images, thus proposing a new paradigm for automatic cataract detection. First, an object detection network is included to locate the eyeball area and eliminate the influence of the background. Next, we construct a dataset with multiple labels for each image. We extract the text descriptions of ultrasound images into labels so that each image is tagged with multiple labels. Then we applied the multi-task learning (MTL) methods to cataract detection. The accuracy of classification is significantly improved compared to data with only one label.

In such a circumstance, federated learning (FL) was proposed to perform model training by multiple clients' combined data without the dataset sharing within the cluster. Nevertheless, federated learning with periodic model averaging (FedAvg) introduced massive communication overhead as the synchronized data in each iteration is about the same size as the model, and thereby leading to a low communication efficiency. Consequently, variant proposals focusing on the communication rounds reduction and data compression were proposed to decrease the communication overhead of FL. In this article, we propose Overlap-FedAvg, an innovative framework that loosed the chain-like constraint of federated learning and paralleled the model training phase with the model communication phase (i.e., uploading local models and downloading the global model), so that the latter phase could be totally covered by the former phase. Compared to vanilla FedAvg, Overlap-FedAvg was further developed with a hierarchical computing strategy, a data compensation mechanism, and a nesterov accelerated gradients (NAG) algorithm. In Particular, Overlap-FedAvg is orthogonal to many other compression methods so that they could be applied together to maximize the utilization of the cluster. Besides, the theoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments conducting on both image classification and natural language processing tasks with multiple models and datasets also demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially reduced the communication overhead and boosted the federated learning process.","tags":null,"title":"Communication-Efficient Federated Learning With Compensated Overlap-FedAvg.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenwei Tang","ZhenanHe,","YunxiaLi,","Jiancheng Lv"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623196800,"objectID":"d04146873e5d0dc4d0b4192651842fb4","permalink":"https://www.dicalab.cn/publication/zero-shot-learning-via-structure-aligned-generative-adversarial-network/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zero-shot-learning-via-structure-aligned-generative-adversarial-network/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we propose a structure-aligned generative adversarial network framework to improve zero-shot learning (ZSL) by mitigating the semantic gap, domain shift, and hubness problem.

It is noteworthy that the performance of CNNs heavily depends on their architecture design, which is a complex process grounded on expert experience and trial-and-error.

However, DKT often ignores the inherent differences between students (e.g. memory skills, reasoning skills, ...), averaging the performances of all students, leading to the lack of personalization, and therefore was considered insufficient for adaptive learning. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we proposed Leveled Attentive KNowledge TrAcing (LANA), which firstly uses a novel student-related features extractor (SRFE) to distill students' unique inherent properties from their respective interactive sequences. Secondly, the pivot module was utilized to dynamically reconstruct the decoder of the neural network on attention of the extracted features, successfully distinguishing the performance between students over time. Moreover, inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), the interpretable Rasch model was used to cluster students by their ability levels, and thereby utilizing leveled learning to assign different encoders to different groups of students. With pivot module reconstructed the decoder for individual students and leveled learning specialized encoders for groups, personalized DKT was achieved. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrated that our proposed LANA improves the AUC score by at least 1.00% (i.e. EdNet 1.46% and RAIEd2020 1.00%), substantially surpassing the other State-Of-The-Art KT methods.","tags":null,"title":"LANA: Towards Personalized Deep Knowledge Tracing Through Distinguishable Interactive Sequences.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kexin Yang","Dayiheng Liu","Qian Qu","YongshengSang","Jiancheng Lv"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617753600,"objectID":"0f5cdfb5adc06489d4dd48e37567839d","permalink":"https://www.dicalab.cn/publication/an-automatic-evaluation-metric-for-ancient-modern-chinese-translation/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/an-automatic-evaluation-metric-for-ancient-modern-chinese-translation/","section":"publication","summary":"As a written language used for thousands of years, Ancient Chinese has some special characteristics like complex semantics as polysemy and the one-to-many alignment with Modern Chinese.

In this paper, we proposed an automatic evaluation metric for Ancient-Modern Chinese Translation called DTE (Dual-based Translation Evaluation), which can be used to evaluate one-to-many alignment in the absence of multiple references. When using DTE to evaluate, we found that the proper nouns often could not be correctly translated. Hence, we designed a new word segmentation method to improve the translation of proper nouns without increasing the size of the model vocabulary.

As a result, the discriminator may forget about the previous target distributions, known as catastrophic forgetting, leading to non-/slow convergence. Through experimental observation, we found that the discriminator does not always forget the previously learned distributions during training. Therefore, we propose a novel generator regulating GAN (GR-GAN). The proposed method encourages the discriminator to teach the generator more effectively when it remembers more of the previously learned distributions, while discouraging the discriminator to guide the generator when catastrophic forgetting happens on the discriminator. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art methods in handling the image data that are with high variability.","tags":null,"title":"Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation between Domains with High Internal Variability.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusen Liu","Dayiheng Liu","Jiancheng Lv","YongshengSang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590278400,"objectID":"e9569620d7cd1f8658f9ec8a57b61e9e","permalink":"https://www.dicalab.cn/publication/generating-chinese-poetry-from-images-via-concrete-and-abstract-information/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/generating-chinese-poetry-from-images-via-concrete-and-abstract-information/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, the automatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has made great progress. Besides focusing on improving the quality of the generated poetry, there is a new topic about generating poetry from an image.

In this paper, we extract and integrate the Concrete and Abstract information from images to address those issues. We proposed an infilling-based Chinese poetry generation model which can infill the Concrete keywords into each line of poems in an explicit way, and an abstract information embedding to integrate the Abstract information into generated poems. In addition, we use non-parallel data during training and construct separate image datasets and poem datasets to train the different components in our framework.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework, dubbed BFGAN, to address this challenge. Specifically, we employ a backward generator and a forward generator to generate lexically constrained sentences together, and use a discriminator to guide the joint training of two generators by assigning them reward signals. Due to the difficulty of BFGAN training, we propose several training techniques to make the training process more stable and efficient.
